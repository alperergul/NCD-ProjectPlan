# NEAR Developer Course

## Project Plan

### Project Name

    üê∑ Pig Game

### What will the project do for user?

    This is a game of chance. Users can use it for fun and earn NEAR.

### How are you using the features of NEAR Protocol?

    By using Persistent Collections, I can separate the games according to their IDs and store the changes with their storage structure. Thus, I create a system where the game progress can be followed. By using the context structure, I can find out who sent the functions in smart contracts or how much NEAR they gave as a deposit and I can make transactions accordingly. With the Assert structure, I can check whether the NEAR given as a deposit is sufficient to create the game or to participate in the game. Again, with the Assert structure, I ensure that the order of moves is not changed. I use it for similar purposes in many places like this.
